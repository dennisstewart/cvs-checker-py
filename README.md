# cvs-checker-py

### how-to
Run the `checkSTATEappointments` file for your state (or city). The program will check for appointments every 60 seconds, and will begin to play music once CVS has appointments available. 

Run `soundcheck` to make sure the music is audible.

Advanced users can run `checkcvs.exe -h` to see additional options.
