### how-to
Run the `STATE_check_appointments` file for your state (or city). The program will check for appointments every 60 seconds, and will begin to play music once CVS has appointments available. 

Run `soundcheck` to make sure the music is audible.

Advanced users can run `checkcvs.exe -h` to see additional options.

Once an appointment is available, schedule it at https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine

If you have any questions, or if this helped you get a vaccination appointment, please email me at:
